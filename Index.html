        <h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
       <p>The plants, animals, and other creatures that inhabit the salty waters of estuaries along the coast
         or the acidic waters of seas and oceans are referred to as aquatic life, sea life, or marine life. 
         Aquarium life has a fundamental impact on the planet's nature. Carbon is stored and oxygen is produced
          by marine organisms, primarily microorganisms. Some aquatic organisms even assist in the creation of
           new land, such as coral reef constructors, and they also help to shape and safeguard shorelines.There
            wouldn't be life on Earth without water. Because it can dissolve a wide range of substances, scientists
             have traditionally referred to water as the solvent of choice. It becomes the ideal setting for bacteria
              to thrive and chemical reactions.</p>

        <p > Prior to the appearance of prehistoric animals, jellyfish have existed on Earth for millions of years. 
            These jelly-like creatures, which can be observed in both deep and shallow seas, in addition to in coastlines,
             are found vibrating along on our ocean currents. Pink, yellow, blue, and purple jellyfish are among the vivid 
             colors discovered between them; some are clear. Additionally, they can produce light—a phenomenon known as bioluminescence!
        No brain, heart, bones, or eyes are found in jellyfish. They are made up of tentacles containing tiny, stinging cells
         and a smooth, bag-like body. The stinging tentacles of these outstanding insects serve to paralyze or stun their prey, that they then eat.</p>

<div class="last1">

<p class="pdp1">
    Jellyfish don't have many enemies in the ocean because they're slimy and some can sting.
     However, a few animals still eat them. Sea turtles, big fish like sunfish, and some birds 
     sometimes snack on jellyfish. Even some little sea slugs munch on them, and they even use 
     jellyfish's stingy cells to protect themselves. Despite these predators, jellyfish populations 
     can still grow fast because they make lots of babies and can live in different conditions.
      This can sometimes cause problems in the ocean and for us humans too.</p>

    Jellyfish primarily prey on small aquatic creatures like plankton, tiny fish, fish eggs,
     and other jellyfish. They catch their prey using their tentacles, which have special cells 
     called nematocysts that release venom when touched. This venom helps jellyfish to immobilize 
     or kill their prey. Some jellyfish species also eat zooplankton and small crustaceans. Despite
      being good at catching prey, jellyfish themselves don't have many predators because of their stinging 
      tentacles and sometimes poisonous body.</p>

                             comb jellies do not possess stinging cells. Instead,they capture prey

                               a sticky substance that ensnares small marine organisms.</p>

              attention in the waters it inhabits. Its distinguishing feature lies in
               its thick, bootlace-like tentacles that can stretch up to an impressive
                length of 10 feet. These long tentacles are armed with extremely venomous
